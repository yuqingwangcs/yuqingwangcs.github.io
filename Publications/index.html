Despite acknowledging potential biases, previous works have lacked thorough investigations into these biases and their impacts. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate biases across seven social factors (e.g., gender, age, religion) using ten LLMs with different prompting methods on eight diverse mental health datasets. Our results show that GPT-4 achieves the best overall balance in performance and fairness among LLMs, although it still lags behind domain-specific models like MentalRoBERTa in some cases. Additionally, our tailored fairness-aware prompts can effectively mitigate bias in mental health predictions, highlighting the great potential for fair analysis in this field.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2023tram" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">TRAM: Benchmarking Temporal Reasoning for Large Language Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yuqing, Wang</em>, and Yun, Zhao </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL</em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00835" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://github.com/eternityyw/tram-benchmark" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Reasoning about time is essential for understanding the nuances of events described in natural language.

Using MP, LLMs undergo a systematic series of structured, self-aware evaluations, drawing on both their vast inherent knowledge and new insights. Our experiments involve five prevalent LLMs: Llama2, Vicuna, PaLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, all of which span various general natural language understanding (NLU) tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks.

These models enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced visual understanding capabilities, facilitating their application in a variety of multimodal tasks. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a cutting-edge MLLM designed specifically for multimodal integration. Despite its advancements, preliminary benchmarks indicate that Gemini lags behind GPT models in commonsense reasoning tasks. However, this assessment, based on a limited dataset (i.e., HellaSWAG), does not fully capture Gemini’s authentic commonsense reasoning potential. To address this gap, our study undertakes a thorough evaluation of Gemini’s performance in complex reasoning tasks that necessitate the integration of commonsense knowledge across modalities. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of 12 commonsense reasoning datasets, ranging from general to domain-specific tasks. This includes 11 datasets focused solely on language, as well as one that incorporates multimodal elements. Our experiments across four LLMs and two MLLMs demonstrate Gemini’s competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we identify common challenges faced by current LLMs and MLLMs in addressing commonsense problems, underscoring the need for further advancements in enhancing the commonsense reasoning abilities of these models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">EMNLP</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2023prominet" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">PROMINET: Prototype-based Multi-View Network for Interpretable Email Response Prediction</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yuqing, Wang</em>, Prashanth, Vijayaraghavan, and Ehsan, Degan </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</em> 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16753" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Email is a widely used tool for business communication, and email marketing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for enterprises. While previous studies have examined factors affecting email marketing performance, limited research has focused on understanding email response behavior by considering email content and metadata. This study proposes a Prototype-based Multi-view Network (PROMINET) that incorporates semantic and structural information from email data. By utilizing prototype learning, the PROMINET model generates latent exemplars, enabling interpretable email response prediction. The model maps learned semantic and structural exemplars to observed samples in the training data at different levels of granularity, such as document, sentence, or phrase. The approach is evaluated on two real-world email datasets: the Enron corpus and an in-house Email Marketing corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that the PROMINET model outperforms baseline models, achieving a  3% improvement in F1 score on both datasets. Additionally, the model provides interpretability through prototypes at different granularity levels while maintaining comparable performance to non-interpretable models. The learned prototypes also show potential for generating suggestions to enhance email text editing and improve the likelihood of effective email responses.

However, inappropriate transfusion decisions made by physicians are often associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs. In this work, we aim to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information for transfusion decision-making on three common blood products (red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma). To this end, we adopt an off-policy batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, namely, discretized Batch Constrained Q-learning, to determine the best action (transfusion or not) given observed patient trajectories. Simultaneously, we consider different state representation approaches and reward design mechanisms to evaluate their impacts on policy learning. Experiments are conducted on two real-world critical care datasets: the MIMIC-III and the UCSF. Results demonstrate that policy recommendations on transfusion achieved comparable matching against true hospital policies via accuracy and weighted importance sampling evaluations on the MIMIC-III dataset. Furthermore, a combination of transfer learning (TL) and RL on the data-scarce UCSF dataset can provide up to 17.02% improvement in terms of accuracy, and up to 18.94% and 21.63% improvement in jump-start and asymptotic performance in terms of weighted importance sampling averaged over three transfusion tasks. Finally, simulations on transfusion decisions suggest that the transferred RL policy could reduce patients’ estimated 28-day mortality rate by 2.74% and decreased acuity rate by 1.18% on the UCSF dataset. In short, RL with appropriate patient state encoding and reward designs shows promise in treatment recommendations for blood transfusion and further optimizes the real-time treatment strategies by improving patients’ clinical outcomes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ICDM</abbr> <div><span class="award badge" style="display: inline-block; max-width: 160px; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">Best Paper Nominee</span></div> </div> <div id="wang2022integrating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Integrating Physiological Time Series and Clinical Notes with Transformer for Early Prediction of Sepsis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yuqing, Wang</em>, Yun, Zhao, Rachael, Callcut, and Linda, Petzold </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Industrial Conference on Data Mining</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14469" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the Intensive Care Units (ICU).

Reliable forecasting is critical to diminish the impact of this disease. To date, a large number of different forecasting models have been proposed, mainly including statistical models, compartmental models, and deep learning models. However, due to various uncertain factors across different regions such as economics and government policy, no forecasting model appears to be the best for all scenarios. In this paper, we perform quantitative analysis of COVID-19 forecasting of confirmed cases and deaths across different regions in the United States with different forecasting horizons, and evaluate the relative impacts of the following three dimensions on the predictive performance (improvement and variation) through different evaluation metrics: model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and the length of time series required for training. We find that if a dimension brings about higher performance gains, if not well-tuned, it may also lead to harsher performance penalties. Furthermore, model selection is the dominant factor in determining the predictive performance. It is responsible for both the largest improvement and the largest variation in performance in all prediction tasks across different regions. While practitioners may perform more complicated time series analysis in practice, they should be able to achieve reasonable results if they have adequate insight into key decisions like model selection.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ICDM</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2021empirical" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Empirical Analysis of Machine Learning Configurations for Prediction of Multiple Organ Failure in Trauma Patients</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yuqing, Wang</em>, Yun, Zhao, Rachael, Callcut, and Linda, Petzold </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Industrial Conference on Data Mining</em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10929" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Multiple organ failure (MOF) is a life-threatening condition. Due to its urgency and high mortality rate, early detection is critical for clinicians to provide appropriate treatment. In this paper, we perform quantitative analysis on early MOF prediction with comprehensive machine learning (ML) configurations, including data preprocessing (missing value treatment, label balancing, feature scaling), feature selection, classifier choice, and hyperparameter tuning. Results show that classifier choice impacts both the performance improvement and variation most among all the configurations. In general, complex classifiers including ensemble methods can provide better performance than simple classifiers. However, blindly pursuing complex classifiers is unwise as it also brings the risk of greater performance variation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ICDM</abbr> </div> <div id="zhao2021bertsurv" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">BERTSurv: BERT-Based Survival Models for Predicting Outcomes of Trauma Patients</div> <div class="author"> Yun, Zhao, Qinghang, Hong, Xinlu, Zhang, Yu, Deng, <em>Yuqing, Wang</em>, and Linda, Petzold </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Industrial Conference on Data Mining</em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10928" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Survival analysis is a technique to predict the times of specific outcomes, and is widely used in predicting the outcomes for intensive care unit (ICU) trauma patients. Recently, deep learning models have drawn increasing attention in healthcare. However, there is a lack of deep learning methods that can model the relationship between measurements, clinical notes and mortality outcomes. In this paper we introduce BERTSurv, a deep learning survival framework which applies Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as a language representation model on unstructured clinical notes, for mortality prediction and survival analysis. We also incorporate clinical measurements in BERTSurv. With binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, BERTSurv can predict mortality as a binary outcome (mortality prediction). With partial log-likelihood (PLL) loss, BERTSurv predicts the probability of mortality as a time-to-event outcome (survival analysis). We apply BERTSurv on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) trauma patient data. For mortality prediction, BERTSurv obtained an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.86, which is an improvement of 3.6% over baseline of multilayer perceptron (MLP) without notes. For survival analysis, BERTSurv achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.7. In addition, visualizations of BERT’s attention heads help to extract patterns in clinical notes and improve model interpretability by showing how the model assigns weights to different inputs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Yuqing Wang.
