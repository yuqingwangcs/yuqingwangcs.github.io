  abstract  = {Email is a widely used tool for business communication, and email marketing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for enterprises. While previous studies have examined factors affecting email marketing performance, limited research has focused on understanding email response behavior by considering email content and metadata. This study proposes a Prototype-based Multi-view Network (PROMINET) that incorporates semantic and structural information from email data. By utilizing prototype learning, the PROMINET model generates latent exemplars, enabling interpretable email response prediction. The model maps learned semantic and structural exemplars to observed samples in the training data at different levels of granularity, such as document, sentence, or phrase. The approach is evaluated on two real-world email datasets: the Enron corpus and an in-house Email Marketing corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that the PROMINET model outperforms baseline models, achieving a ~3% improvement in F1 score on both datasets. Additionally, the model provides interpretability through prototypes at different granularity levels while maintaining comparable performance to non-interpretable models. The learned prototypes also show potential for generating suggestions to enhance email text editing and improve the likelihood of effective email responses. This research contributes to enhancing sender-receiver communication and customer engagement in email interactions.},

  abstract  = {Reasoning about time is essential for understanding the nuances of events described in natural language. Previous research on this topic has been limited in scope, characterized by a lack of standardized benchmarks that would allow for consistent evaluations across different studies. In this paper, we introduce TRAM, a temporal reasoning benchmark composed of ten datasets, encompassing various temporal aspects of events such as order, arithmetic, frequency, and duration, designed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We conduct an extensive evaluation using popular LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Llama2, in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we employ BERT-based models to establish the baseline evaluations. Our findings indicate that these models still trail human performance in temporal reasoning tasks. It is our aspiration that TRAM will spur further progress in enhancing the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs.},

  abstract  = {In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in task-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design. While recent research on prompting has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, a gap remains in further improving their understanding abilities. In this study, we introduce Metacognitive Prompting (MP), a strategy inspired by human introspective reasoning processes. Using MP, LLMs undergo a systematic series of structured, self-aware evaluations, drawing on both their vast inherent knowledge and new insights. Our experiments involve five prevalent LLMs: Llama2, Vicuna, PaLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, all of which span various general natural language understanding (NLU) tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. Results indicate that, although GPT-4 consistently excels in most tasks, PaLM, when equipped with MP, approaches its performance level. Furthermore, across models and datasets, MP consistently outperforms existing prompting methods, including standard and chain-of-thought prompting. This study underscores the potential to amplify the understanding abilities of LLMs and highlights the benefits of mirroring human introspective reasoning in NLU tasks.},

Although it exhibits impressive performance predominantly on natural images, understanding its robustness against various image perturbations and domains is critical for real-world applications where such challenges frequently arise. In this study we conduct a comprehensive robustness investigation of SAM under diverse real-world conditions. Our experiments encompass a wide range of image perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAM's performance generally declines under perturbed images, with varying degrees of vulnerability across different perturbations. By customizing prompting techniques and leveraging domain knowledge based on the unique characteristics of each dataset, the model's resilience to these perturbations can be enhanced, addressing dataset-specific challenges. This work sheds light on the limitations and strengths of SAM in real-world applications, promoting the development of more robust and versatile image segmentation solutions.},

However, the specialized nature of clinical language understanding tasks presents unique challenges and limitations that warrant further investigation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard, within the realm of clinical language understanding tasks. These tasks span a diverse range, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, natural language inference, semantic textual similarity, document classification, and question-answering. We also introduce a novel prompting strategy, self-questioning prompting (SQP), tailored to enhance LLMs' performance by eliciting informative questions and answers pertinent to the clinical scenarios at hand. Our evaluation underscores the significance of task-specific learning strategies and prompting techniques for improving LLMs' effectiveness in healthcare-related tasks. Additionally, our in-depth error analysis on the challenging relation extraction task offers valuable insights into error distribution and potential avenues for improvement using SQP.

  abstract  = {As critically ill patients frequently develop anemia or coagulopathy, transfusion of blood products is a frequent intervention in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). However, inappropriate transfusion decisions made by physicians are often associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs. In this work, we aim to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information for transfusion decision-making on three common blood products (red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma). To this end, we adopt an off-policy batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, namely, discretized Batch Constrained Q-learning, to determine the best action (transfusion or not) given observed patient trajectories. Simultaneously, we consider different state representation approaches and reward design mechanisms to evaluate their impacts on policy learning. Experiments are conducted on two real-world critical care datasets: the MIMIC-III and the UCSF. Results demonstrate that policy recommendations on transfusion achieved comparable matching against true hospital policies via accuracy and weighted importance sampling evaluations on the MIMIC-III dataset. Furthermore, a combination of transfer learning (TL) and RL on the data-scarce UCSF dataset can provide up to 17.02% improvement in terms of accuracy, and up to 18.94% and 21.63% improvement in jump-start and asymptotic performance in terms of weighted importance sampling averaged over three transfusion tasks. Finally, simulations on transfusion decisions suggest that the transferred RL policy could reduce patients' estimated 28-day mortality rate by 2.74% and decreased acuity rate by 1.18% on the UCSF dataset. In short, RL with appropriate patient state encoding and reward designs shows promise in treatment recommendations for blood transfusion and further optimizes the real-time treatment strategies by improving patients' clinical outcomes.},

Specifically, we aim to predict sepsis using only the first 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 hours of laboratory measurements, vital signs, patient demographics, and clinical notes. We evaluate our model on two large critical care datasets: MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD. The proposed method is compared with six baselines. In addition, ablation analysis and case studies are conducted to study the influence of each individual component of the model and the contribution of each data modality for early sepsis prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms competitive baselines on all metrics.},

  abstract  = {COVID-19 has been a public health emergency of international concern since early 2020. Reliable forecasting is critical to diminish the impact of this disease. To date, a large number of different forecasting models have been proposed, mainly including statistical models, compartmental models, and deep learning models. However, due to various uncertain factors across different regions such as economics and government policy, no forecasting model appears to be the best for all scenarios. In this paper, we perform quantitative analysis of COVID-19 forecasting of confirmed cases and deaths across different regions in the United States with different forecasting horizons, and evaluate the relative impacts of the following three dimensions on the predictive performance (improvement and variation) through different evaluation metrics: model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and the length of time series required for training. We find that if a dimension brings about higher performance gains, if not well-tuned, it may also lead to harsher performance penalties. Furthermore, model selection is the dominant factor in determining the predictive performance. It is responsible for both the largest improvement and the largest variation in performance in all prediction tasks across different regions. While practitioners may perform more complicated time series analysis in practice, they should be able to achieve reasonable results if they have adequate insight into key decisions like model selection.},

Results show that classifier choice impacts both the performance improvement and variation most among all the configurations. In general, complex classifiers including ensemble methods can provide better performance than simple classifiers.

Recently, deep learning models have drawn increasing attention in healthcare. However, there is a lack of deep learning methods that can model the relationship between measurements, clinical notes and mortality outcomes. In this paper we introduce BERTSurv, a deep learning survival framework which applies Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as a language representation model on unstructured clinical notes, for mortality prediction and survival analysis. We also incorporate clinical measurements in BERTSurv. With binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, BERTSurv can predict mortality as a binary outcome (mortality prediction). With partial log-likelihood (PLL) loss, BERTSurv predicts the probability of mortality as a time-to-event outcome (survival analysis). We apply BERTSurv on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) trauma patient data. For mortality prediction, BERTSurv obtained an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.86, which is an improvement of 3.6% over baseline of multilayer perceptron (MLP) without notes. For survival analysis, BERTSurv achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.7. In addition, visualizations of BERT's attention heads help to extract patterns in clinical notes and improve model interpretability by showing how the model assigns weights to different inputs.},
