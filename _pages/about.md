Postdoctoral Scholar in <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/">Biomedical Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>

Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford under <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/boussard-lab">Boussard Lab</a>. Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>
in 2023, where I was advised by <a href="https://cse.cs.ucsb.edu/">Prof. Linda Petzold</a>. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>, where I was advised by 
<a href="https://kaitlinhill.weebly.com/">Prof. Kaitlin Hill</a>. I work on machine learning and natural language processing, with a focus on healthcare, social science, and general language understanding. Overall, I aim to fortify the reliability and trustworthiness of 
language models in diverse applications, ensuring that they contribute positively and ethically, especially in critical domains like healthcare.
